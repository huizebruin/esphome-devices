## Description

### What is the S0tool?

The **S0tool** is a small device that counts pulses from water or electricity meters. It works with **ESPHome** and can be used in **Home Assistant**. The S0tool connects to meters that use either an **NPN pulse output** or an **S0 interface**.

It can help you track how much water or electricity you use. This is useful for keeping an eye on your consumption, spotting problems like leaks, or just collecting data for automation.

### Key Features

- Works with ESPHome and Home Assistant  
- Supports water meters with NPN output  
- Supports energy meters with S0 output  
- Small and easy to mount  
- Suitable for DIY installations

---
If your meter supports **S0** or **NPN pulse output**, it should work with the S0tool.
